In the span of only a few years, R has become the Lingua Franca of
statistics. The Titanic Introduction to R (TITR) is a series of
workshops presented by the <abbr title="Epidemiology and Biostatistics
Community of Practice">EBCoP</abbr> <a
href="http://www.health.ny.gov/" target="_blank">(New York State
DOH)</a> and the <a href="http://www.albany.edu/rockefeller/homepage/"
target="_blank">Rockefeller College of Public Affairs & Policy (SUNY
Albany)</a>. Each workshop is a free three hour cruise which
introduces one or more key R concepts. Each workshop includes slides,
participant materials (code, data, etc.) and resources to further
participant development. Each participant should have access to a
laptop or desktop computer running <a
href="https://www.cran.r-project.org/" target="_blank">R</a>, and
either <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/" target="_blank">RStudio</a>,
<a href="http://ess.r-project.org/" target="_blank">ESS</a>, or <a
href="http://www.walware.de/goto/statet" target="_blank">Statet</a>
during a workshop.

These workshops are _not_ a replacement for a traditional statistics
background. These workshops _do_ teach participants programming and
implementation skills needed to use R to complete real-world
analytical challenges.
