excerpt: "My mea culpa for failing to document all of the awesomeness that is TITR."

The TITR materials were originally written for the Epidemiology and
Biostatistics Community of Practice (EBCoP) at DOH. Since these
materials were written, I have left DOH, but others have continued to
present TITR to DOH employees, contractors, etc.

They carry on some really important work - and they are doing a great
job. That said, I believe I owe them an apology. I know there were at
least two rounds of TITR in late 2017 and winter of 2018, which I
failed to document in a post (BAD ANDY!).

Apologies to one and all and I look forward to continuing to
collaborate with you and improve TITR.

In the short term - I want to move this website off of jekyll. I'm not
a Ruby dev and using Ruby limits me in how far I can push the
interactivity on this site. I think we are long overdue for some JS
magic around here.
