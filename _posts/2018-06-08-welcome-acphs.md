I am looking forward to the first TITR session at ACPHS. These
materials have previously been presented to DOH staff/contractors and
SUNY Rockefeller students. This will be my first time leading a TITR
session in front of a different audience. Should be very intersing.

These materials have been fairly static for the last year or so. In
the interest of Continuous Quality Improvement, I went through the Day
1 morning workshop presentations and made a number of tweaks,
improvements, and modifications. Hopefully things will flow a little
easier now. I am going to review the afternoon presentations before I
go to bed and hopefully make another round of improvements.

The biggest single change I have introduced is to NOT supply course
participants with a Code file. I have ALWAYS provided a fully
documented R Script to accompany each presentation. Tomorrow, I will
not. I am curious to see how that affects the delivery of the materials.
