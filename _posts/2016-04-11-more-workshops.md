I would like to write more three hour cruises! Topics I am interested
in include:

- R, SQL and SQLUtils
- Machine Learning
- Intermediate R Programming:
  - Functions, packages, etc.
- Advanced R Programming:
  - Folder Structure
  - Git
- Shiny

But there are only so many hours in a day. If you would like to help,
let me know.
