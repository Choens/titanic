        This workshop is the next-step after the Titanic
        Introduction. Reviews the data management skills previously
        introduced and builds upon them with a real-world analytical
        project. Participants learn how to build a linear model to
        understand factors affecting passenger survival, such as
        gender and age. At the end of the workshop, participants use
        this model to predict survival against a provided test data
        set.
