    </dt>
    <dd>
        Participants learn primary data types, vectors and
        data.frames. Participants are introduced to R indexes and
        practical skills like filtering data. By the the end of the
        workshop, participants will have been introduced basic data
        management techniques using base R and will have run simple
        statistical tests such as the Student's T-test and and the
        Chi-Squared test.

        Reviews and builds on the data management skills introduced in
        "Icebergs Ahead". Participants use these skills to complete a
        real-world analytical project. Participants learn more about
        running statistical tests in R and how to build linear and
        logistic regression models. By the end of the workshop,
        participants will have built a model to predict aboard the
        Titanic and will have tested it against a provided test data
        set.
