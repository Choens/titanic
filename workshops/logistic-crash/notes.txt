- Data Import and Exploration
  - Discuss a session, ls, etc.
  - Introduce working directory
  - Import csv and data cleanup
  - Interactive plotting
- Example Linear Regression
  - Does class predict age?
  - by(), group_by
  - plot(passengers$pclass, passengers$age)
  - end with plot on lm
- Kaggle
  - What is Kaggle?
  - Kaggle Titanic Page
  - Kaggle sign up
- Your First Predictive Models
  - Dummy example (everyone lives!)
  - Dummy example (everyone dies!)
- Logistic Regression Models
  - glm / logistic regression does gender predict survival?
  - summary( lm(passengers$survived~passengers$sex))
  - plot( glm(passengers$survived~passengers$sex, family=binomial))
- Let's Add Age!
  - Hmmm. Missing Data
  - g = glm(survived~age, family=binomial, passengers)
  - plot(passengers$survived, passengers$age)
  - curve(predict(g,data.frame(passengers=x),type="resp"),add=TRUE)
    - I think my problem is in predict
