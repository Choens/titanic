## Four Freedoms of Free Software

- **Freedom 0:** The freedom to run the program for any purpose
- **Freedom 1:** The freedom to study how the program works, and change it to make it do what you wish
- **Freedom 2:** The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor
- **Freedom 3:** The freedom to improve the program, and release your
  improvements (and modified versions in general) to the public, so
  that the whole community benefits

## Imagine, Open Research

- Data can't always be public
- IF DOH intentionally releases PHI, we go to jail
- But, our methods, our assumptions: These things are not private, but
  they do influence the end result
- Imagine research where statistical methods and application were all
  100% transparent
