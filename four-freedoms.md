The underlying goal of this workshop is to enable researchers to
communicate more effectively, via open source languages such as R. In
the 21st century, software has become the language of science. A
language that should not be owned by proprietary tools which limit the
researcher's ability to communicate and share important work.

This logic is based on Richard Stallman's / Free Software Foundations
Four Freedoms.

## Four Freedoms of Free Software

The logic and ideology of the Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)
movement is predicated upon four software freedoms. These freedoms
are:

- **Freedom 0:** The freedom to run the program for any purpose
- **Freedom 1:** The freedom to study how the program works, and change it to make it do what you wish
- **Freedom 2:** The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor
- **Freedom 3:** The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements (and modified versions in general) to the public, so that the whole community benefits

## Free Research?

I challenge you to apply this same logic to research. Imagine a world
in which data (when possible) and code (always) is shared.

- **Freedom 0:** The freedom to reproduce the analysis for any purpose
- **Freedom 1:** The freedom to study how the analysis works, and change it to make it do what you wish
- **Freedom 2:** The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor
- **Freedom 3:** The freedom to improve the analysis, and release your improvements (and modified versions in general) to the public, so that the whole community benefits

Research, especially research funded by public funds, should be
accessible and reproducible by anyone in the community. There are some
specific domains, such as healthcare and child welfare where privacy
needs clearly trump the need for transparency. I am not advocating
against HIPPA. I am simply advocating for transparency.

Unlike the data, the code used in analyses of public programs contains
no privileged or confidentia data. Code doesn't have PHI! Therefore,
the code should be free. This logic runs in the same direction as Open
Data sites, but open data without open code is harder for the public
to use and does not give the public insight into the practices and
beliefs of the institutions governing them.
