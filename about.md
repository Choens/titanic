In the span of only a few years, R has become the Lingua Franca of
statistics. The Titanic Introduction To R is a series of workshops
presented by the <abbr title="Epidemiology and Biostatistics Community
of Practice">EBCoP</abbr> <a href="http://www.health.ny.gov/"
target="_blank">(New York State DOH)</a> and the <a
href="http://www.albany.edu/rockefeller/homepage/"
target="_blank">Rockefeller College of Public Affairs & Policy (SUNY
Albany)</a>. Each workshop is a free three hour cruise which
introduces one or more key concepts in R. Each workshop includes
slides, participant materials (code, data, etc.) and resources to
further participant development. Each participant will have access to
a laptop or desktop computer running <a
href="https://www.cran.r-project.org/" target="_blank">R</a>, and
either <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/" target="_blank">RStudio</a>,
<a href="http://ess.r-project.org/" target="_blank">ESS</a>, or <a
href="http://www.walware.de/goto/statet" target="_blank">Statet</a>.

These workshops are _not_ a replacement for traditional statistics
courses. These workshops build on a traditional statistics background
by teaching participants programming and implementation skills needed
to use R to complete real-world analytical challenges.

## Why R?

<p class="message">
The following article attempts to introduce you to why I think R
should be used for scientific research.

## What Is R?

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_%28programming_language%29), R is:

- An  ~~clone~~ implementation  of S
- A language that uses ~~static~~ lexical  scoping
- An  ~~kinda pokey~~ interpreted language for statistical analysis

<br/>


- SAS was developed at the North Carolina State University
  in 1966. The SAS institute was formed in 1976. In spite of its long
  relationship with health care, it was originally developed to analyze
  agricultural data.
- John Chambers started programming S in 1976 to replace a bunch of
  Fortran routines used at Bell Labs (part of AT&T).
- The aim of the language is: "to turn ideas into software, quickly
  and faithfully".
- R is an open source descendant of S
- The big improvement -  lexical scoping!
- Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman started programming R in 1996 - 1996.
- R is referred to as the lingua franca of data analysis.
